### House Rent Information Web Application

This project is a simple web application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL to provide users with information about house rents in specific areas of Hyderabad.

#### Key Features:
1. **User Interface (UI)**: The front-end is developed using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements. The UI allows users to input the area they are interested in and view rent details.

2. **Database Management**: SQL (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) is used to store and manage house rent data. The database schema includes tables for storing information such as area name, type of accommodation (apartment, house), number of rooms, and rent amount.

3. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for house rents by entering the area name or selecting from a dropdown list of available areas. The application queries the SQL database based on user input and retrieves rent information to display it on the webpage.

4. **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction experience across various devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).

#### Technologies Used:
- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- **Back-end**: SQL database (e.g., MySQL, SQLite)
- **Server-side Scripting**: Optional (e.g., PHP for server-side processing)
- **Deployment**: Hosted on a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)

#### Purpose:
This web application serves as a practical tool for individuals looking to rent properties in Hyderabad. It provides an easy-to-use platform where users can quickly access and compare house rent prices in different areas. By leveraging basic web technologies and SQL, the project aims to streamline the process of finding suitable accommodations based on location and budget constraints.

### Example Workflow:
1. **User Input**: Users enter the area name they are interested in or select from a dropdown list of available areas.
